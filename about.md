# About

Josselin Noirel â€” I'm a lecturer in human henetics and systems biology ([section 64](Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) of the CNU).  My interests lie in investigating the genotype-phenotype relationship with a view either to control biological systems (synthetic biology) or to understand complex diseases (personalised medicine).

I'm teaching bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics, mathematics and programming using R and Python.

I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/JosselinNoirel) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/josselin.noirel).
