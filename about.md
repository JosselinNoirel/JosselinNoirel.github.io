Josselin Noirel â€” I'm a lecturer in human henetics and systems biology ([section 64](Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) of the CNU).  My interests lie in investigating the genotype-phenotype relationship with a view either to control biological systems (synthetic biology) or to understand complex diseases (personalised medicine).

I'm teaching bioinformatics, statistical genetics, computational biology, statistics, mathematics and programming using R and Python.
