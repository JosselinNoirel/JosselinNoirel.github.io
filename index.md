## Research



## Teaching

* My [practical bioinformatics exercises](https://josselinnoirel.github.io/practical_bioinformatics/) (work in progress)

## R stuff

* A *ggplot2* axis
  transform
  [reverse_log10](https://gist.github.com/JosselinNoirel/291b087bf5691669d4fcf6c667445459) to
  help with quantile-quantile plots and Manhattan plots; also check
  out the *scales* package which comes with a pseudo-log transform
  (although improvements could be made to how the breaks are chosen)

## Shiny apps

* Coming soon: A Shiny app to check out the popularity of first names in France
  across the 20th and 21st centuries
* A Shiny app to stay up to date with
  the [COVID19 pandemic](https://shiny.cnam.fr/CoVid19/)

Hosted by
the
[Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers](https://www.cnam.fr/),
which is the awesome place I happen to work at.
